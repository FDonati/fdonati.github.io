A python3 package to create and analyze Circular Economy scenarios.

### What is pycirk
Pycirck is a python package to model Circular Economy policy and technological interventions in multi-regional Environmentally Extended Input-Output Analysis (mrEEIO). The software allows to define an indefinite number of changes in all matrices of the mrEEIO system and an indefinite number of scenario. Furthermore, it allows to easily set multiple parameters for results so that users can investigate different dimensions of the economic system.
